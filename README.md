## Legal Notice

> **STOP. Read this before running anything.**

This project scrapes LinkedIn's public job search pages. **Scraping LinkedIn
may violate LinkedIn's Terms of Service** and may expose the operator to
civil and/or criminal liability depending on jurisdiction (including but not
limited to the EU's GDPR, Spain's AEPD/LOPDGDD, and the United States' CFAA).

By downloading, building, running, or otherwise using this software, **you
acknowledge and accept the following**:

- You assume **all** legal risk. The authors and contributors of this project
  accept **no** liability for misuse, account bans, IP blocks, or legal
  action taken against you.
- This is **not** a production-grade job aggregator. It is an educational
  exercise that demonstrates how to combine FastAPI, Playwright, and
  hexagonal architecture. There is no SLA, no support, no reliability
  guarantee, and no warranty of any kind.
- Do not use this software to redistribute LinkedIn data, to bypass rate
  limits, to evade anti-bot measures, or for any commercial purpose.
- If you are unsure whether your use case is legal, **consult a lawyer** in
  your jurisdiction before running this code.

If you are not willing to accept these terms, **do not run this software**.

## What this is

`jobs-finder` is the first slice of a multi-source job-search engine. It
exposes a single HTTP endpoint that, on each request, launches a headless
Chromium browser via Playwright, navigates to LinkedIn's public job search,
parses the result cards, and returns structured JSON. It is bootstrapped
as a hexagonal Python project (domain / application / infrastructure /
presentation) so additional job sources (InfoJobs, etc.) and a frontend can
be added in follow-up changes without rewrites.

### CORS — development default is `*`; override for production

`Settings.cors_allow_origins` defaults to `["*"]` so a browser-based dev
client can call the API without extra wiring. **This is NOT safe for
production.** Set the `LINKEDIN_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS` env var to a
comma-separated allowlist before exposing the service publicly, e.g.

```bash
LINKEDIN_CORS_ALLOW_ORIGINS="https://app.example.com,https://admin.example.com" \
  uv run uvicorn jobs_finder.main:app --port 8000
```

### Structured JSON logs (with `request_id`)

Log lines are emitted as single-line JSON to stderr with the field set
locked to `{timestamp, level, name, message, request_id}`. The
`request_id` field is filled from the `X-Request-Id` request header
(generated if absent) so a single grep can join a request, its
response, and any error logged during processing. Set
`LINKEDIN_LOG_FORMAT=plain` for a human-readable fallback.

## Stack

- **Python** 3.12
- **FastAPI** + **uvicorn** (HTTP layer)
- **Playwright** + Chromium (scraper)
- **httpx** (in-process API tests)
- **pydantic-settings** (env-driven configuration)
- **uv** (package manager and virtualenv)
- **mypy --strict** (type checking)
- **ruff** (lint + format)
- **pytest** + **pytest-asyncio** (test runner)

## Quick start

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies into a project-local virtualenv
uv sync

# 2. Run the test suite (no network, no Chromium)
uv run pytest

# 3. Static type check
uv run mypy

# 4. Lint
uv run ruff check

# 5. Format check
uv run ruff format --check
```

## Manual verification

> **Re-read the Legal Notice above before proceeding.** Scraping LinkedIn
> violates LinkedIn's Terms of Service. This procedure exists to confirm
> the implementation works on a real page; it is **never** executed in
> CI or in the automated test suite. By running it you accept the legal
> risk documented at the top of this README.

The automated test suite is hermetic — it never contacts LinkedIn and
never launches a real browser. The procedure below is the only signal
that the live code path works against a real page, and it is **expected
to break** when LinkedIn changes their DOM or anti-bot surface. The
test suite is not a substitute for this procedure; they verify
different things.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12, `uv` installed.
- Network access to `linkedin.com` from the host running the service.

### Procedure

```bash
# 1. Install project dependencies (no Playwright browser yet).
uv sync

# 2. One-time: download the Chromium binary used by Playwright.
#    Skipped by the test suite; required only for the live path.
uv run playwright install chromium

# 3. Start the API. Defaults to 0.0.0.0:8000.
uv run uvicorn jobs_finder.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

In a second terminal, exercise the endpoints:

```bash
# 4. Liveness probe — must return 200 with `{"status":"ok"}` and
#    MUST NOT trigger a browser launch.
curl -i "http://localhost:8000/health"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
{"status":"ok"}
```

```bash
# 5. Happy path — must return 200 with `{"jobs": [...]}` and a
#    `X-Request-Id` response header.
curl -i "http://localhost:8000/jobs/linkedin?keywords=python&location=madrid"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
content-type: application/json
x-request-id: <uuid-or-your-trace-id>

{
  "jobs": [
    {
      "id": "3850000001",
      "title": "Senior Python Developer",
      "company": "Acme Corp",
      "location": "Madrid, Spain",
      "url": "https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/3850000001/",
      "posted_at": "2026-05-01T00:00:00+00:00"
    }
  ]
}
```

```bash
# 6. Trigger a 502. Two reproducible ways to do it:
#
#    a) Temporarily point the scraper at a URL that always returns
#       the auth wall (e.g. by setting LINKEDIN_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=1
#       so the wait-for-selector times out and the scraper raises
#       LinkedInTimeoutError, which is a JobSearchError → 502).
LINKEDIN_REQUEST_TIMEOUT_MS=1 uv run uvicorn jobs_finder.main:app --port 8000
curl -i "http://localhost:8000/jobs/linkedin?keywords=python&location=madrid"
```

```http
HTTP/1.1 502 Bad Gateway
content-type: application/json
x-request-id: <uuid-or-your-trace-id>

{
  "detail": "upstream source unavailable",
  "request_id": "<same-uuid-as-x-request-id>"
}
```

The body's `request_id` MUST equal the `X-Request-Id` response header.
The body's `detail` MUST be the literal string
`"upstream source unavailable"` — the underlying exception type
(`LinkedInTimeoutError`, `LinkedInBlockedError`, ...) is masked.

### When the live path breaks

If step 5 returns `200 {"jobs": []}` and the HTML is the auth wall, the
live page structure has changed from the fixture. The maintenance
burden is yours from this point on:

1. Open `src/jobs_finder/infrastructure/linkedin/parsers.py` and update
   the private selector constants (`_TITLE_SELECTOR`,
   `_COMPANY_SELECTOR`, etc.) and any per-field parser that depends on
   the old DOM.
2. Open `tests/fixtures/linkedin_search.py` and replace the inline
   `SEARCH_PAGE_HTML` and `BLOCK_PAGE_HTML` literals with a fresh
   recording from a real browser session.
3. Re-run `uv run pytest` — every parser and scraper test must pass
   against the new fixture.
4. Retry step 5 above.

The automated test suite cannot catch a live DOM drift; only this
manual procedure can.
